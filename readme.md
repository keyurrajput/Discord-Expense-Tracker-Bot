### Running the Bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can start tracking expenses:

1. **Open Discord** and send a direct message to your bot
2. **Track an expense** by sending a message in one of these formats:
   - `amount, item` (e.g., "150, lunch")
   - `amount, item, place` (e.g., "45, samosa, bikaner")

3. **Use commands** in your DMs with the bot:
   - `!total` - See the sum of all expenses
   - `!today` - See today's expenses with breakdown
   - `!help` - Get usage instructions

## Example Usage

```
You: 150, lunch
Bot: ðŸ’° Expense tracked: â‚¹150 for lunch

You: 45, samosa, bikaner
Bot: ðŸ’° Expense tracked: â‚¹45 for samosa at bikaner

You: !today
Bot: **Today's Expenses:**
â‚¹150 - lunch (N/A)
â‚¹45 - samosa (bikaner)

**Total:** â‚¹195.00
```

## Google Sheet Structure

The bot creates a Google Sheet with the following columns:
- **Timestamp**: Exact time of the expense entry
- **Date**: Just the date portion
- **Amount**: The expense amount
- **Item**: What was purchased
- **Place**: Where it was purchased (if provided)

## Customization

You can modify the `bot.py` file to:
- Change the sheet name by updating `SHEET_NAME`
- Add more commands for different expense analyses
- Customize confirmation messages

## Troubleshooting

**Bot doesn't respond to DMs**
- Make sure you've invited the bot to a server you're in
- Check that you've enabled "Message Content Intent" in the Discord Developer Portal
- Verify your bot token is correct in the `.env` file

**Can't connect to Google Sheets**
- Check that your `credentials.json` file is in the project directory
- Ensure the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API are enabled
- Verify the service account has proper permissions
